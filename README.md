This is a modern, CMS-driven portfolio website built using Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, and Payload CMS.

The project uses Payload’s block-based architecture to manage page layouts (Home, About, Contact, Projects) dynamically from the admin panel.

Content such as sections, cards, and forms are fully configurable without code changes, while the frontend remains clean, typed, and component-based.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate real-world usage of a headless CMS with a modern React framework, following scalable and maintainable patterns.
